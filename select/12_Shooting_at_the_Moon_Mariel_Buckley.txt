I've played in motel bars, dingy lounges with dirty floors
Queen of the one star room
Every night it seems I am living someone else's dream
Can I have one too
Every night I sleep on flowered sheets
And I think of you
I wanna be the underdog
Up against the wind
Shooting at the moon
Knowing if I bring it down
That it'll rise again
I've dressed in fancy clothes and hung out where all the money goes
But the talk, it is cheap
They only tell you what they think you're gonna wanna hear
I wanna hear the truth
I don't mind getting scraps, the more I took the less I had
I had it all with you
I would trade it all now if I could for that motel room
With a view
To be the underdog
Up against the wind
Shooting at the moon
Knowing if I bring it down
That it'll rise again
I hear the echo bouncing off the walls
It sounds a lot like me
All the other voices sound so sweet but honey, they don't know
Who I used to be
I wanna be the underdog
Up against the wind
Shooting at the moon
Knowing if I bring it down
That it'll rise again
I wanna be the underdog
Up against the wind
Shooting at the moon
Knowing if I bring it down
That it'll rise again
