I walked her to the plane in Phoenix
I said: "Say hello to your mama."
She couldn't even look me in the eye
I drove out to the desert
Just like nothing happened
But somewhere in the darkness
I heard her say goodbye
[Chorus]
Now I hear voices in the wind
Sayin she ain't comin back to me
I look for guidance in the sky
But the stars have all gone out tonight
I feel like the love of my life is dying
Even the man in the moon is crying
I'm burnin up this blacktop
Headin down to Austin
I wonder if she misses me tonight
I wish that I could tell her
How much I love her
And I wish this damned ol' Thunderbird could fly
Now I hear voices in the wind
Sayin she ain't comin back to me
I look for guidance in the sky
But the stars have all gone out tonight
I feel like the love of my life is dying
Even the man in the moon is crying
Now I hear voices in the wind
Sayin she ain't coming back to me
I look for guidance in the sky
But the stars have all gone out tonight
I feel like the love of my life is dying
Even the man in the moon is crying
Even the man in the moon is crying
Even the man in the moon is crying
Even the man in the moon is crying
