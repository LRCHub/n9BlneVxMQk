Music & lyrics: john popper
I ain't no broken-winged bird
My reams fly high
And I can't go on a memory
Can't accept or deny
I don't really know how to feel
now
But I'm getting used to that
How instantly the feelings
Never leave and still come back
And that same old role has been
played
And that age old course has
been laid
And as usual, I'm afraid
But by heaven or hell, I will
not be swayed
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
I think my heart is a racehorse
Whenever you're around
When there's usually a leaf
It tumbles to the ground
And I'm looking out my window
At a brand new day's begin
A junkie who is hurting
For seeing you again
And that same old role has been
played
And that age old course has
been laid
And as usual, I'm afraid
But by heaven or hell, I will
not be swayed
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
But if it takes till forever
I will try to understand
Though I guessed I may never
These wings won't let me land
So I still keep on guessing
Till an instant makes it clear
This instant I am addressing
The instant you get here
I feel your soul coming on
And soon will fill my mind
I guess there are feelings
You just can't leave behind
The racehorse is off and running
And headed round the bend
Though jockey he is fearful
Saying here we go again
And that same old role has been
played
And that age old course has
been laid
And as usual, I'm afraid
But by heaven or hell, I will
not be swayed
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
By the light of the moonlight
serenade
